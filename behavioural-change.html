            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>The project aimed to enhance privacy awareness and cybersecurity within Amsterdam-based healthcare institutions, focusing on OpenKAT, a tool developed by the Dutch Ministry of Health to identify system vulnerabilities and prevent data breaches. Collaborating with Sigra, a healthcare network, the group designed a website prototype to promote OpenKAT's accessibility and usage. The research question was: How to make Amsterdam-based healthcare institutions more privacy-aware using a website as a behavior change tool?
                    The theoretical frameworks used included the Fogg Behavioral Model (FBM) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), guiding the website’s design to increase motivation and ability for target users. The goal was to educate stakeholders and simplify complex cybersecurity concepts, targeting both management and employees to drive individual and organizational change.</p>

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>The group conducted a focus group with privacy and data security officers to understand the needs and preferences of key stakeholders. Insights revealed the importance of effectively communicating OpenKAT’s benefits, designing a user-friendly website that accounts for generational differences, and including real-life use cases to demonstrate the tool's practical applications. The focus group findings informed the creation of two website prototypes for A/B testing. Version A retained the original OpenKAT branding, while Version B introduced a more professional design to test its impact on user engagement and trust. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the two designs, the OpenKAT branding of Version A was ultimately preferred for consistency. Technical limitations and a restricted sample size during testing, however, highlighted the need for further research with the target healthcare audience.</p>

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>The project successfully developed a functional website prototype that incorporated stakeholder feedback and adhered to theoretical models of behavior change. Despite its achievements, the project faced limitations, including a limited sample size and the inability to test with the intended healthcare audience, reducing the generalizability of findings. Additionally, combining multiple design changes in A/B testing made it challenging to isolate the effects of individual design elements on engagement.
                    Future work should include broader testing with healthcare stakeholders to validate findings and improve website effectiveness. Collaboration with OpenKAT developers could also integrate instructional guides and explanatory content to simplify adoption. By incorporating success stories, instructional videos, and additional user-focused features, the website could further enhance motivation and ability among its audience, making a significant impact on privacy awareness and cybersecurity in the healthcare sector.</p>
