                <p>Facial recognition technology (FRT) is increasingly being implemented in airports as a replacement for traditional boarding passes. This study investigates how this transition affects travelers' trust in privacy protection at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Trust and privacy concerns are central to the debate, as biometrics involve sharing sensitive personal data. Stakeholders such as airports, airlines, regulatory bodies (IATA and EASA), and travelers have varying perspectives on this transition. While airports and airlines seek efficiency and reduced errors, travelers express concerns about data storage and privacy. The study draws on survey findings from 108 respondents of diverse socio-cultural backgrounds to explore public attitudes toward biometric boarding passes, with a focus on efficiency, safety, and privacy.</p>

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>The survey revealed that socio-cultural identity significantly influences attitudes toward biometric boarding, with Western Europeans showing greater openness to the technology for efficiency, while Eastern Europeans and North Americans exhibited more hesitancy. Interestingly, North Americans appeared less influenced by privacy concerns compared to Europeans, displaying inconsistent attitudes toward biometric boarding. Despite privacy apprehensions, respondents across all groups showed increased willingness to share biometric data when efficiency improvements were emphasized, highlighting a trade-off between convenience and privacy. Travelers expressed skepticism about private companies handling biometric data but prioritized efficiency and safety, with motivations for adopting the technology differing among groups—efficiency being more appealing to Eastern Europeans and safety resonating more with others. Additionally, the survey found no significant differences in trust toward governmental versus private entities managing biometric data.</p>

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>The transition to biometric boarding passes impacts trust in privacy protection. While efficiency motivates adoption, uncertainty about data security and a lack of informed consent remain significant barriers. The study concludes that better communication and transparency from airports and airlines are essential to build trust and increase acceptance. Future research should include larger and more diverse samples, alongside direct engagement with stakeholders like airports and airlines, to gain a deeper understanding of broader societal and regulatory implications. Ultimately, balancing efficiency, safety, and privacy will be critical to ensuring the successful implementation of biometric boarding technology.</p>
