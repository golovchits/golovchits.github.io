                                    <p>This study investigates how political party policies on economics and social inequality affect income inequality, using the Palma ratio as a measure. The research focuses on the period following the Great Recession and uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Key tools include the Manifesto Project dataset for analyzing party policies and the UNU-WIDER World Income Inequality Database for income inequality data. A Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) regression model was developed, complemented by qualitative validation using human and machine (ManifestoBerta) classification of political manifestos.</p>

                                    <p>The study found that while certain economic policy stances, such as welfare state expansion, were statistically significant predictors of the Palma ratio, they alone were insufficient to fully explain income inequality. Qualitative analysis revealed discrepancies between human and machine classifications of political manifestos, driven by local contexts and personal biases, which exposed the limitations of the ManifestoBerta model. Auditing with the Microsoft Responsible AI Toolbox highlighted regional and feature-specific variability, underscoring the importance of fairness measures in machine learning models.</p>

                                    <p>The rapid proliferation of drones has created new challenges in airspace security, where existing anti-UAV systems are limited by their reliance on single-modality data such as RGB video. These systems struggle under adverse conditions like low light, occlusions, or high clutter. Recent benchmarks such as AntiUAV600 (thermal) and TRIDENT (RGB, audio, RF) provide diverse modalities but lack integrated approaches for uncertainty-aware sensor fusion. This project aims to develop a real-time Bayesian or evidential deep learning framework that fuses RGB, thermal, and acoustic signals, explicitly modelling prediction uncertainty to reduce false positives and enhance robustness.</p>

The internship focused on addressing real business challenges at the intersection of computational methods, data science, and AI implementation. My central research question was: "How can AI technologies be implemented to monitor and maintain different payment terms set in contracts while ensuring compliance with guidelines and negotiated terms?"</p>

                                    <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                                    <p>Versuni manages complex procurement processes across multiple regions, facing significant challenges in maintaining consistency in procurement practices, particularly regarding payment terms with vendors. These inconsistencies led to financial inefficiencies, compliance issues, and strained supplier relationships. Through extensive data analysis, I discovered that approximately 15% of payment terms in the system contained some form of inconsistency or required verification, highlighting the critical need for systematic monitoring and intervention.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Approach</h4>
                                    <p>The project employed a mixed-method approach combining literature review, semi-structured interviews, internal documentation analysis, and stakeholder collaboration. I created custom data quality metrics and cross-validation methods between related data sources to address data inconsistencies. While exploring various AI implementation techniques including fine-tuning and RAG-based systems with open-source models like Llama and phi-3-mini, I ultimately leveraged Microsoft Copilot Studio with Microsoft Power Automate flows to balance technical feasibility, user accessibility, and business impact within project constraints. The development process incorporated principles from the Technology Acceptance Model to ensure perceived usefulness and ease of use, directly informing user interface and functionality decisions.</p>

                                    <h4>VIRA: The Solution</h4>
                                    <p>I developed VIRA (Versuni Intelligent Retrieval Assistant), an AI-driven virtual procurement assistant designed to oversee, monitor, and optimize payment terms in procurement processes. Built using Microsoft Copilot Studio due to organizational constraints around computational resources and data security, VIRA was designed following the principle of augmenting human decision-making rather than replacing it. The system integrated multiple data sources including SAP systems, contract management databases, regional payment term guidelines, and supplier master data. Through Agency Theory, VIRA functions as a mechanism to reduce information asymmetry between procurement managers and staff, making payment term data transparent and accessible while ensuring compliance with established guidelines.</p>

                                    <h4>Key Achievements</h4>
                                    <p>VIRA successfully created a centralized access point for previously fragmented payment term information, significantly reducing the time spent searching for payment term data. The system provides real-time payment term status monitoring across regions and vendors, vendor-specific payment term history, recent purchase order reviews with contextual information, integration with Supplier Account Manager reporting, and access to general procurement knowledge. By developing a classification framework that categorized payment terms as "healthy," "unhealthy," or "review," VIRA provided actionable intelligence for procurement professionals. The system was integrated into Microsoft Teams for workplace accessibility and designed with natural language queries matching procurement vocabulary, ensuring high user satisfaction and adoption.</p>
