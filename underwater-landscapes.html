                <p>Amsterdam’s centrum canals face ecological degradation due to pollution and boat traffic, failing to meet the European Water Framework Directive (EWFD) goals for biodiversity and water quality by 2027. Key contributors include sewage overflows during heavy rainfall, urban runoff carrying nitrogen and phosphorous, and disturbances caused by boat activity. This research explored how nature-based solutions (NBS) can address these challenges, integrating sustainability with biodiversity goals. Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, including experts from Waternet and private water technology companies, provided insights into the current inhibitors of water quality and actionable interventions.</p>

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>The study identified three primary interventions to address water quality and biodiversity issues in Amsterdam’s centrum canals. Floating gardens emerged as a viable solution, offering the dual benefits of nutrient absorption and habitat creation for wildlife. These gardens rely on native plant species with submerged root systems and recyclable materials for construction, ensuring ecological sustainability. Another intervention, boat zoning, involves designating low or no-boat zones to minimize disturbances caused by boat traffic. This measure allows ecosystems to stabilize, fostering conditions for plant and animal life to thrive. Additionally, stormwater filtration systems were proposed to tackle urban runoff, preventing contaminants such as heavy metals, nitrogen, and phosphorous from entering the canals. This intervention complements the city’s ongoing efforts to upgrade its sewer systems and withstand extreme weather conditions.</p>

            <button class="dropdown-button">Future Directions</button>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>To meet the European Water Framework Directive (EWFD) goals by 2027, the study emphasized the need for large-scale implementation of these interventions. Expanding floating garden initiatives through public-private partnerships can maximize their effectiveness, while simplifying permitting processes can encourage widespread adoption among private waterfront owners. Stricter regulations on houseboat waste disposal and the introduction of targeted boat zoning in high-impact areas will further alleviate water quality degradation. Increasing the deployment of stormwater filtration systems in urban zones with significant runoff will also be essential. Public education campaigns and awareness initiatives are recommended to promote a shift in citizen attitudes and behaviors, empowering individuals to contribute to the ecological health of the canals. By adopting these strategies, Amsterdam can successfully restore biodiversity and improve the ecological health of its iconic waterways.</p>
